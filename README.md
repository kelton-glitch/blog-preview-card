## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using `HTML` and `CSS` to do markup sometimes looked like a struggle till I did it myself from scratch and enhoyed it with all the fun that comes together with it. I did a review of some basic ``HTML & CSS concepts`` to help me navigate this task just `HTML and CSS`

```css
.card::before {
        left: 2px;
        top: 4px;
        width: 100%;
        height: calc(100% - 10px);
        border-radius: 15px;
    }
```

Figuring this card out was such a massive relieve especially in order to make it more responsive.
